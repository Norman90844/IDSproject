# Lung Cancer Survival Prediction with Synthetic Data

Authors: Marten Mathias Jaani, Norman Tolmats, Joosep Lember

(Provide the motivation and goal of the project)
The goal of the project is to create a universal workflow that returns a model and the AUC-ROC score for different diseases. We use synthetc Lung Cancer Survival data to make the workflow. 

The goal of this project is to predict mortality within one-year period with a workflow that finds the most important features and returns the most accurate model. 

To use these workflows, you can use the Jupyter Notebook file. There, you can enter the name of your data file, and the workflow will find the most important features and return the most accurate model.

Explain how it is possible to take the code and replicate the same analysis that the authors have done
