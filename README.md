# Lung Cancer Survival Prediction with Synthetic Data

Authors: Marten Mathias Jaani, Norman Tolmats, Joosep Lember

The goal of this project is to predict mortality within a one-year period using a workflow that identifies the most important features and returns the most accurate model.

To use these workflows, you can use the Jupyter Notebook file. There, you can enter the name of your data file, and the workflow will find the most important features and return the most accurate model.

Explain how it is possible to take the code and replicate the same analysis that the authors have done
